# lift-simulation web app

live link - https://lift-simulation-pi.vercel.app/

This simple web app tries to simulate a real world multiplayer lift system.

Features - 

- Design your own lift system
  
  This app gives you the flexibility to choose your own layout - no. of lifts & floors (subject to screen size)

- Multiplayer

  This app supports multiplayer simulation. It means multiple persons at different floors can use the lift system for their prefered direction (up/down) simultaneously and the lift handles the request as per priority algorithm.

- Individual & Floor lift control

  The app gives you the flexibility to choose a specific lift as well as it supports floor control i.e., that makes sure that the lift that is nearest to the queue reaches the floor first.

- Group Handling

  The lift system is designed in a way that if you require multiple lifts in a floor, you could press the floor button, this would ensure every lift stops at that floor for the specific (up/down) diresction as per priority algorithm.




Thanks for having a look.
